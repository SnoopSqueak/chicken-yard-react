// HEY! Make sure to check out the README if you'd like to know what order
//   I recommend checking out each component. Of course, it's just a suggestion.
//   Do what you want and have fun learning React! :-)

import React, { Component } from 'react';
// The Actor takes care of the basic setup for positioning and animation.
// React does not encourage using inheritance -- for example, I'm not using
//   `class Chicken extends Actor`. Rather, both Actor and Chicken are
//   Components, and to get Chicken to "extend" Actor, I have the Chicken
//   component render an Actor component.
import Actor from './Actor';
class Chicken extends Component {
  constructor (props) {
    super(props);
    // Each chicken will either start or stop wandering after 0-5 seconds.
    // This value is not stored on the state, partly because I don't want to
    //   make a `setState` call when I adjust the value every tick. See `tick`.
    this.timeUntilChange = Math.random() * 5000;
  }

  // This function runs every so often. The interval is up to the user, with
  //   an initial value defined all the way back in the App component.
  // `elapsedTime` represents approximately how much time it has been since the
  //   previous tick. I say "approximately" because I'm using `msPerTick` rather
  //   than actually measuring the time. I could measure the time by declaring
  //   a Date object each tick and subtracting the previous Date object from it
  //   to get something closer to the actual elapsed time, but I don't think
  //   that kind of precision is necessary for this project, and it could
  //   negatively impact performance.
  tick (elapsedTime) {

            //   to have a config file where you could specify different poses,
            //   their frames, and the amount of time between each frame, but
            //   it ended up being unnecessary when I decided on a global speed
            //   for updates, the `msPerTick` prop.
            // I could move it off of the state by setting `this.pose` in Actor,
            //   but that would require rewriting parts of this Chicken function,

            //   I'll be working on it forever.

            //   the same as 360 degrees, but I can use the built-in trig
            //   functions like `cos`, `sin`, and `atan2` with radians.

          //   places to say, "Hey JavaScript, skip the rest of this part."
          // If we didn't have `break`, it would continue to check the next
          //   case even if it already found something to do. Sometimes that's

    // There is an unused frame of chicken animation, as well as an unused
    //   egg sprite. Originally I was going to have the chickens lay eggs to
    //   hatch other chickens, but I didn't want to spend too many days on
    //   this project. Maybe another time... or maybe you can fork it and give
    //   it a shot!

  // This is an unfortunately confusing part of the design I ended up with.
  // The Yard component has a `registerActor` function that it uses to store
  //   actors in an array. Actors in this array are updated when the window is
  //   resized, so it's important that all actors in the Yard are added to this
  //   array. However, the Chicken component also wants to track the actor, so
  //   the Chicken has it's own `registerActor`. Instead of simply passing
  //   `this.props.registerActor` down to its Actor in the Chicken's `render`
  //   function, I'm passing a reference to the Chicken's `registerActor`,
  //   which then calls `this.props.registerActor`. It's fairly confusing.
  // For contrast, check out the Bush component later.
  registerActor (actor) {
    this.props.registerActor(actor);
    this.actor = actor;

        //   set it to 5 here. This value is used by Actor to determine which
        //   part of the sprite to show. If it doesn't match the actual number
        //   of frames, or if the image's width is not a multiple of 32, it will
        //   cause interesting graphical glitches.
        // I thought about adding an `imageRows` as well to support

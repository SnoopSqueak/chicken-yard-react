# Guide to Reading My Comments

I recommend going through each file from top to bottom in this order:
1. App.js
2. Yard.js
3. Chicken.js
4. Actor.js
5. Bush.js

...but you might find it useful to jump around.

Also, I don't suggest running `npm start` on this branch. I wanted the comments to be right above the relevant section of code, so I added JavaScript comments directly into JSX, which doesn't really work. Many of the comments are treated as text and displayed in the DOM. Switch to the master branch if you want to try the app.

Happy coding!

## Installation

Clone the project and run `npm install` in the project directory.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

*You should really switch to the master branch before doing this.*

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
